      <h2>Reducing Light Pollution in Kathmandu Valley</h2>
      <p>
        Designed an automated lighting system using motion and object sensors
        to reduce unnecessary nighttime illumination. The prototype demonstrated
        adaptive wavelength control to minimize environmental and health impacts
        of light pollution.

      <h2>Hazardous Terrain Exploration Rover</h2>
      <p>
        Led the development of a mobile-controlled rover equipped with live camera
        feed, proximity sensors, and stabilization architecture to explore
        hazardous and inaccessible terrain. The project highlighted applications
        in mining and disaster-response scenarios in Nepal.

    <section>
      <h2>Smart Greenhouse & Automated Irrigation System</h2>
      <p>
        Built a self-funded smart greenhouse integrating soil moisture sensors,
        automated irrigation, and adaptive light spectrum control to optimize plant
        growth while conserving resources. Recognized by national-level science
        organizations.
