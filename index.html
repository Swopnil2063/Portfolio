                                         <br> <br>
                                        In 2024, I was honored to receive the Valedictorian Award for the Grade 12 NEB +2
                                        
                                        Science curriculum at Premier. This recognition was not just a reflection of my
                                        academic performance as the highest-scoring student, but also of my dedication,
                                        perseverance, and commitment to excellence throughout my academic journey.
                                        <br> <br>
                                        The experience of being awarded valedictorian was humbling and surreal. As I
                                        walked across the stage to accept the award, I felt an overwhelming sense of
                                        gratitude toward my teachers, family, and peers. I knew that this achievement
                                        wasnâ€™t just a personal victory but the result of constant support and
                                        encouragement from those around me. It was a testament to the collaborative
                                        spirit of the school community.
                                        During my time in the NEB +2 Science program, I put in countless hours of
                                        studying, balancing the demands of rigorous coursework, extracurricular
                                        activities, and personal growth. Despite the pressure, I always felt a sense of
                                        purpose and determination, knowing that each challenge I faced was an
                                        opportunity to grow.

                                        <br> Receiving the Valedictorian Award was a moment of reflection. It felt like

                                        responsibilityâ€”to use my skills and knowledge to inspire others and continue to

                                        As part of a STEM initiative, my team and I developed a prototype designed to
                                        tackle the growing issue
                                        of light pollution in the Kathmandu Valley, an area densely populated and
                                        increasingly affected by this
                                        overlooked environmental concern. Our project aimed to raise awareness about the
                                        invisible yet
                                        significant consequences of light pollution on the environment and human health.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The prototype featured motion and object sensors, enabling an automated lighting
                                        system that activated
                                        only when an object was nearby. Additionally, it demonstrated how various
                                        wavelengths of light can be
                                        utilized effectively during different times of the day. For instance,
                                        incorporating red-wavelength lighting
                                        at night promotes soothing and restful sleep, showcasing potential health
                                        benefits.
                                        This project highlighted the importance of sustainable and adaptive lighting
                                        systems as a means to reduce
                                        light pollution while enhancing environmental and human well-being.

                                        led a STEM initiative to
                                        develop a mobile-controlled rover designed for hazardous terrains. This project
                                        sought to shed light on the
                                        vast opportunities within Nepalâ€™s mining sector and demonstrate how technology
                                        can facilitate
                                        exploration in challenging environments. <br>
                                        <br>

                                        The rover was equipped with a live camera feed for real-time visuals, proximity
                                        sensors to navigate
                                        obstacles, and a steady body architecture for stability on uneven surfaces. Its
                                        integrated lighting system
                                        ensured functionality even in low-visibility conditions, making it an ideal
                                        solution for accessing and
                                        analyzing inaccessible mining areas.
                                        This initiative was recognized for its vision and dedication, earning a visit
                                        from the Robotics Association
                                        of Nepal, which commended the projectâ€™s potential to revolutionize mining
                                        exploration in the country. It
                                        stands as a testament to how innovative technology can pave the way for
                                        sustainable resource
                                        development in Nepal.

                                        As a member of the Science Awareness Club, I had the opportunity to engage junior
                                        students in science through interactive and educational demonstrations. One of
                                        the most memorable projects I led was a hands-on experiment that showcased the
                                        phenomenon of polar and non-polar dissolution. The goal was to demonstrate a
                                        fundamental concept of chemistry in a way that was both visually compelling and
                                        easy to understand for younger students, encouraging them to explore the world
                                        of science.
                                        The experiment itself was simple yet powerful: I used water (a polar solvent)
                                        and oil (a non-polar substance) to show how the two substances do not mix,
                                        perfectly illustrating the principle that "like dissolves like."

                                        <br> Over 100 junior students attended the session, and their enthusiasm was
                                        evident from the many questions they asked and the excitement they expressed
                                        after the experiment. Several students came up to me afterward, eager to learn
                                        more about other scientific phenomena and ask how they could conduct similar
                                        experiments at home.
                                        The success of this experiment was incredibly fulfilling. It sparked an interest
                                        in science among the students and reinforced my belief in the importance of
                                        making science accessible and fun.

                                    <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I created the Chill Zone, a dedicated online server
                                        for students to socialize, relax, and stay connected while navigating the
                                        isolation of remote learning. Initially, the Chill Zone served as a virtual
                                        space for students to interact, share experiences, and support each other
                                        through the challenges of the pandemic. The server quickly grew to include 150+
                                        members, becoming a space where students could unwind, play games, and engage in
                                        casual conversations.
                                        As time went on and students began to face academic challenges, I decided to
                                        introduce a sub-program of study sessions within the Chill Zone. These sessions
                                        were designed to help students stay on track with their studies, providing a
                                        structured yet relaxed environment where they could collaborate, ask questions,
                                        and work through difficult topics together.

                                        <br> <br>
                                        The study sessions were informal, with a focus on peer-to-peer learning, making
                                        it easier for students to learn from one another. Over 20 students participated
                                        in the study program, and the impact was evident. Students reported significant
                                        improvements in their academic performance, with many experiencing a boost in
                                        their grades and confidence.

                                        <br> <br>
                                        By providing a space for both social interaction and academic support, I was
                                        able to help students overcome the challenges of remote learning, build
                                        confidence, and achieve better academic results.

                                    <p>During our final board exams, I founded NEB Toppers, a Discord community
                                        dedicated to collaborative
                                        study. I have always believed in the power of teamwork to bring out the best in
                                        myself, and this platform
                                        provided an ideal space for us to study together, support each other, and
                                        achieve our academic goals.
                                        Working alongside my peers, we tackled complex concepts with multiple
                                        perspectives, making learning
                                        more engaging and effective. The ability to discuss, explain, and clarify topics
                                        as a group allowed us to
                                        enjoy the process and make the most of every study session. This collaborative
                                        approach not only made
                                        studying more enjoyable but also significantly improved our understanding, which
                                        contributed to better
                                        grades and successful outcomes in the external board exams.
                                        The experience of creating and leading NEB Toppers reinforced my belief in the
                                        importance of
                                        collaboration and shared effort, and it was a truly rewarding way to prepare for
                                        one of the most important
                                        academic milestones of our lives.

                                        <br>
                                        What began as a casual family activity during vacations quickly turned into a
                                        deep and lasting passion for
                                        swimming. Iâ€™ll never forget the thrill of winning my first medal â€“ that moment
                                        ignited a drive in me to
                                        push beyond my limits and strive to be the best.
                                        Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of competing in numerous national-level
                                        competitions, consistently
                                        finishing among the top swimmers in my state. Being ranked among the top 3 in my
                                        state has been an
                                        incredible achievement, and earning prestigious medals in these competitions has
                                        been a testament to the
                                        dedication and hard work Iâ€™ve put into my training. <br> <br>
                                        Swimming has not only taught me discipline and resilience, but it has also been
                                        a source of strength and
                                        motivation throughout my life. Whether in the pool or outside of it, the lessons
                                        Iâ€™ve learned through
                                        swimming have shaped my mindset and approach to challenges.
                                        No matter where life takes me, swimming will always be my go-to sport â€“ a place
                                        where I find clarity,
                                        strength, and a sense of purpose. Itâ€™s not just a sport for me; itâ€™s a part of
                                        who I am, and it will always hold
                                        a special place in my heart.

                                        I founded Gadget Dai with the mission to help local tech businesses expand their
                                        reach by effectively
                                        advertising their products. In a fast-paced, competitive market, many businesses
                                        struggle to gain visibility,
                                        and I wanted to bridge that gap by offering a platform for showcasing
                                        high-quality tech products to a
                                        broader audience. <br> <br>


                                        Through Gadget Dai, Iâ€™ve worked to highlight and promote tech gadgets, providing
                                        well-researched
                                        content and honest reviews to help businesses stand out in the market. By
                                        focusing on effective digital
                                        marketing strategies, Iâ€™ve helped local tech brands connect with potential
                                        customers and boost their sales,
                                        especially through platforms like Daraz, an Amazon-like marketplace in Nepal.
                                        <br>
                                        Itâ€™s been incredibly rewarding to see Gadget Dai grow, assisting local
                                        businesses in reaching new heights,
                                        and Iâ€™m proud to contribute to the tech ecosystem in Nepal through this venture.

                                        Growing up in a close-knit neighborhood, I was fortunate to be surrounded by a
                                        group of friends who
                                        shared similar passions and aspirations. From a young age, we bonded over our
                                        love for music, often
                                        jamming together with whatever we could get our hands on â€“ whether it was a
                                        speaker or just makeshift
                                        instruments. Music became our common language, a way for us to stay connected
                                        and share our energy. <br>
                                        As we grew older, our desire to keep that musical spark alive led us to learn
                                        different instruments, and
                                        thatâ€™s when Aairawat Boys was born. Formed three years ago, the band is not just
                                        a musical project; itâ€™s
                                        the culmination of years of friendship, shared experiences, and the joy of
                                        creating music together. Iâ€™m a
                                        self-taught guitarist in the band, and playing alongside such talented friends
                                        has been one of the most
                                        rewarding parts of this journey. <br>
                                        Over the years, weâ€™ve performed at numerous local festivals and events, and each
                                        performance has only
                                        strengthened our bond and love for music. Itâ€™s not just about the music â€“ itâ€™s
                                        about the memories weâ€™ve
                                        created and the way it has brought us closer together. Aairawat Boys is more
                                        than just a band; itâ€™s a
                                        symbol of the friendships that have flourished through the power of music, and
                                        it will always remain an
                                        integral part of my life.<br>
